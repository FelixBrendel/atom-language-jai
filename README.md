# Odin language support in Atom


Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for [Odin](https://github.com/gingerBill/Odin) files in [Atom](http://atom.io/).

**Note:** Odin is still incomplete and has no formal specification yet. There are likely missing or improperly-highlighted structures.

## Install

Install the package `language-odin` in Atom (Preferences->Packages) or Atom's package manager:

```bash
$ apm install language-odin
```
